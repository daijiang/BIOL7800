## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

How many viewers does each video in the **MIT linear algerbra** playlist contain how do the videos stand up to time?

[**MIT playlist**] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8)
```{r}
library(rvest, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(RSelenium)
```
1st upload packages for the job at hand "warn.conflicts = false' is to suppress start up messages and warnings

set up a server to run javascript and load the webpage
 ###rs= start a selenium server and browser (firefox)###

```{r}
rs = RSelenium::rsDriver(browser = "firefox")
rsc = rs$client
rsc$navigate("https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8")

```
`"rsc = rs$client"` shorten access to client (webbrowser that you open)
`rsc$navigate` navigate to indicated site

retrieve page source (that webpages sourcecode,info to display webpage)
use Rvest to read the html code of that one page with R
define lectures by scanning the defined url using css for the "video title"
```{r}
ht=rsc$getPageSource()
url= rvest::read_html(ht[[1]])
lectures= html_elements(url, css = '#video-title')
```
extract plain text from lectures html code define as lec_names
extract the links (href)on lecture area /w html_attr
attach youtube web address to links extracted
```{r}
lec_names= html_text2(lectures)
lec_links=html_attr(lectures, "href")
lec_links_full = paste0("https://www.youtube.com", lec_links)
```
at this point the selenium server has been uploaded and used firefox to scan the webpage for the lectures scraping the names and links

instruct rvest to get a view count of one link
define url2 as a command to read the html code for the links collected and appended /w lec_links_full (designate target)
then define x as scanning url2 for css (#info) 
css cascading style sheets are html language use to style info/elements on a page
```{r}
url2 = read_html(lec_links_full[1])
x = html_elements(url2, css = "#info")
```
direct the client browser to the lecture links ammassed and appended `lec_links_full`get the source code, html, of that page with `getPageSource()` label as ht2 
ht is the source code of (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8)
instruct rvest n "ok2" to read the html code of the source code of the lec links full page
```{r}
rsc$navigate(lec_links_full[1])
ht2=rsc$getPageSource()
ok2<- rvest::read_html(ht2[[1]])
```


define view as scanning the `lec_links_full` source code for css html code corresponding to ".ytd-video-view-count-renderer" (year to date format video view count element to be rendered for webpage)
define "viewcount" as the retrival of the raw text of the designated element (view[1])

use gsub for view_count, search for ",| views" replace with "" and make numeric value

```{r}
view= html_elements(ok2, css=".ytd-video-view-count-renderer" )
view_count= html_text(view[1])
view_count
as.numeric(gsub(",| views","",view_count))
```
