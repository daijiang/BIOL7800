title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

#Web scraping and API

```{r}
# on startup install following
librarian:: lib_startup("httr", "RSelenium", "rvest", "RCurl", lib = "/home/derek/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1", global = FALSE)
#set up the list of packages required
packages12 <- c( "httr", "Rselenium", "rvest", "RCurl", "dplyr")
#set up a vector for checking on the installation of packages req
# define lesson12 packages as containing packages12
lesson12_packages<- packages12 %in% rownames(lesson12_packages)
# then if any packages12 missing from lesson12_packages install missing lesson 12 packages
if (any(lesson12_packages == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(packages12[!lesson12_packages])
}


```

```
\\d = match a digit character
\\.* = match metacharacter "." 0 or more times (*=optional)
\\d* = match digit character 0 or more times
subject = vector x

str_view = view first match in vector x for digit character, atmost one meta character(.?) atmost one digit character
