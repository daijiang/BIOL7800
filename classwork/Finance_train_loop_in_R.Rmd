This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

R has three types of loops 
`for`
`while`
`repeat`

also there is `tapply`, `apply` ((apply function to vector(array hw3)), and `lapply` for implicit application, think less specific/detailed looping when compared to the above three that require setting of subject and explicit instructions for specific instances. the apply's are simple broad application of basic functions like mean, median, sum, product. 

for the three main loops there are two statements to moderate its use
`next` and `break`
if you think of looping as a way of dictating instructions for the computer to cycle through the vector/dataset/array/list applying specific checks or functions with each previously specified instance
`breaks` are used to stop the current itteration of instructions via the current loop and if possible switch to the first statement outside the loop otherwise it ends

## break example
```{r}
#here is a for loop with one layer/level
#set subject (each value in 1-5) add condition in brackets {if (i==4) break}
# add expression to apply for each value of subject print the pasting of "this is..." to each value in subj 1-5

for (i in 1:5) {
  if (i ==4){
    break
  }
  print(paste( "this is step", i))}
# incorporation of the "next" statement after the subject (each value in 1-5) and condition if (i==4) returns to the the machine to the beginning of the loop
for (i in 1:5) 
{  if (i==4) {  
    next  }
  print(paste( "this is step", i))}
```
using next returns the machine to the beginning of the loop to continue without ending cycle like break
A next statement is useful when we want to skip the current iteration of a loop without terminating it. On encountering next, the R parser skips further evaluation and starts next iteration of the loop.

`for` loops execute for a
prescribed number of times, as controlled by a counter or an index,
incremented at each iteration cycle

general formula
"for" (variables in seq/vector){
command 1
}

the command will be applied once to each variable in the seq

init- initialization this is the beginning 
init is where the instructions are evaluated (identify all values and vectors to be applied to) 

the diamond- the condition to be applied is begun, beginning the loop((for x values in vector) carry out "x + m/ a" or "v e seq" )  with each statement/expression
"v e seq"- does the variable `v`’s current value belong to the sequence `seq`?”
in this case does the variables value fall in the range of parameters set in vector of 

> 1st step
+ if false break loop
+ if true carry out iteration one to end of set parameters

```{r}


```
its important when looping to create a empty vector to store results if not at final step

```{r}
storage<- numeric(5)
for (i in 1:5) {
storage[i]<- i^2  
  
}
print(storage)
```
