## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Background
rmarkdown is a plain text file with .rmd extension to reccord your code, results, comments as to provide a complete reccord of your work.

rmarkdown has 3 elements
YAML Header(yaml aint markup language): Controls certain output settings that apply to the entire document. (braced /w ----'s)

Code Chunk: Includes code to run, and code-related options. (usually starts /w ````{r})
  a- Code to Generate a Table: Outputs a table with minimal formatting like you would see in the console.


 b- Code to Generate a Plot: Outputs a plot. Here, the code used to generate the plot will not be included because the parameter echo=FALSE is specified. 
Body Text: For communicating results and findings to the targeted audience.
